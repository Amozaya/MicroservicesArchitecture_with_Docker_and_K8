# What is K8

Kubernetes (also know as K8) is a container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.




## When not to use Microservices

Microservices architecture is a great way to manage a large project, thanks to it flexibility and scalibility. However, it also requires a high maintanance and a high cost. So if your project is of a small scale and there is no plan of expanding and growing in the future, then it might be much simplier and more cost effective to use a Monolith or N-tier architecture instead.

## When not to use K8 - disadvantages

* You don't need K8 unless you have a large-scale application that run on multiple services that communicate with each other
* It involves steep learning curve, so it might take time to learn how to use it
* Requires learning of multiple tools
* Requires high maintanance and cost
