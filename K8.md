# What is K8

Kubernetes (also know as K8) is a container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.




## When not to use Microservices

Microservices architecture is a great way to manage a large project, thanks to it flexibility and scalibility. However, it also requires a high maintanance and a high cost. So if your project is of a small scale and there is no plan of expanding and growing in the future, then it might be much simplier and more cost effective to use a Monolith or N-tier architecture instead.

## When not to use K8 - disadvantages

* You don't need K8 unless you have a large-scale application that run on multiple services that communicate with each other
* It involves steep learning curve, so it might take time to learn how to use it
* Requires learning of multiple tools
* Requires high maintanance and cost


## Benefits of K8

* Reduced development and release time

* Optimizes cost

* Increased scalability and availability

* Flexibility in multi-cloud environments

* Cloud migration

## Installing K8

1. Open Docker
2. Go to Settings
3. Select `Kubernetes` and then tick the box that says "Enable Kubernetes" and click on "Apply and Restart". It will take some time download and install Kubernetes. 

After Installation is over it can be a good practice to restart your machine.

You can use `kubectl` in the Bash terminal in order to check if K8 is installed. If yes, it will give you a list of commands for K8.

Use `kubectl get svc` to check the services running.

## Creating an nginx deployment service

1. In your project folder create a new YAML file, for example `nginx-deployment.yml`.
2. Write the following script:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1 # which api to use for deployment

kind: Deployment # what kind of service/object do you want to create?
# what would you like to call it - name of the service
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment # naming deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx #look for this label to match with k8 service
  # Replica set 
  replicas: 3
  #template to use
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx #this label connects to the service or any other k8 component

    # Container spec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: olegf23/tech221-nginx:v1 #use the image from Docker
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
            
```

3. `kubectl create -f nginx-deployment.yml` - use this command to create a service, where `-f` means file, and `nginx-deployment.yml` is the name of the YAML script.
4. You can use `kubectl get deploy` to check services deployed
5. `kubectl get pods` - shows you the status of pods
6. `kubectl delete deploy nginx-deployment` - to delete the service
